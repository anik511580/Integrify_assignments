# Review on exercise Pandas 4, 5 and Functional 


## Pandas exercise 4: 

Everything is done as instructed in the exercise. Mainly focused on importing the libraries, datasets, ratio calculation and mean.


## Pandas exercise 5: 

This exercies is focused on timeseries. Importing the libsaries and dataset has been done, finding the data type and converting the type has been done as well. Other operations are delete and group by. 
Finding the the most dangerous decade to live in the US was not completed 

## Functional programming: 

This assignment was done quite well using lambda funstions. Also, GCD was calculated correctly using reduce function. Some comments in the program codes would have been more readable for the other user.
