# Goal: Review on NumPy Tutorial 


**1. Did that particular submission cover all needed commands?**
They have done almost all the commands which are related to programming.

**2. If not, what  were missing?**
- Explanation of page 7 is missing 
- 5 command from Numpy documentation is missing 

**3.  Our experience on Google cobab**
It's a simple and quite useful tool to do python programming. It works almost like google doc. It works also for pair programming but a bit trickey in the beginning.  For example, if both of work in the different shell of a same file, and if someone save, then other persons work got deleted. 
So, the solution was - before saving we inform each other. Then one save first and then other reload the file to be updated. and then we continue. However, for safety reason, its good to download, have a back up and then try to save the work.
